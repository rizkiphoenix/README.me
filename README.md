My GitHub Journey Begins

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! My name is Rizki, and I'm a student just starting my exciting journey into the world of coding. I'm brand new to GitHub, so this profile is currently a blank slate, full of potential!

I'm super excited to learn about Python programming, game design, data science basics and start building my very first projects. But, right now, I'm focusing on "Python fundamentals".
